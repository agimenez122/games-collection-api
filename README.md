# Video Games collection api in node express


Simple API for managing a video game collection, it's essentially a complete CRUD with endpoints for adding, deleting, etc...

Basically, it's a simple API to experiment with Node and Express.

The empty endpoint (/) returns a "Server Up!" message to confirm that the API is running.
